This dashboard shows a broad overview of 2019 CitiBike ride data compared to 2020 CitiBike ride data.

## Year Overview

The biggest shock to 2020 life was the COVID-19 pandemic, and this comparison seeks out some key differences that may have been impacted by the pandemic. Overall, the total number of rides increased by .15%.

A closer breakdown by month (this data uses February, May, August, and November as representatives of each season/quarter) shows that before pandemic restrictions were widely enacted, rides were up by 21% in February. It's unclear how much this increase was impacted by the relatively mild winter (February 2020 was the second least snowy February recorded in New York City) or if this would have been a trend for the entire year without the pandemic. Considering ride data per day of week, February rides showed a similar pattern of rides in 2019 and 2020 with more weekday than weekend rides, suggesting that commuters contributed more to total ridership numbers than recreational rides.

Unsurprisingly, rides were down by 22% in May, during which time New York City, although no longer under a stay at home order, had restrictions on businesses and social gathering. Considering ride data by day of the week, the data strongly suggests that ridership declined due to a drop in weekday rides, likely commuters. Notably, weekend rides increased compared to 2019, suggesting that riders were still taking trips, just not necessarily to work.

August riders nearly picked back up to 2020 levels, still showing a similar pattern to May rides with fewer weekday rides than weekend rides. This trend may be related to outdoor summer activity.

November rides increased by 17% compared to 2019, with increased rides for every day of the week, closing the gap between weekday and weekend rides slightly compared to the previous two quarters, but not enough so that rides on a given weekday were greater than a weekend day.

## Ridership Explained by Customers versus Subscribers & Gender
The difference in ridership between 2019 and 2020 is not likely explained by subcribers versus customers (customers paying for single rides versus customers with subscriptions). Although customers represent a larger proportion of rides in 2019 compared to 2020, the overall total count of subscribers is less in 2020, meaning that the change in the proportion of customer is more likely due to a drop in subscriber rides rather than an increase in customer rides.

The difference in ridership is partially explained by gender. Although the overall breakdown by gender favors males and 2020 rides did not increase significantly overall, female ridership increased by 18% while male ridership decreased by 11% from 2019 to 2020.

Considering the day of the ridership data, the female rides are less impacted by jumps in weekday rides, suggesting that female riders are less likely to commute by CitiBike than male riders. Since weekday rides decreased during 2020, this drop in male weekday rides is consistent. That being said, male ridership was still more than double that of female ridership in 2020 so there is still a disparity.

## Most Popular Stations
The change in weekday commuter rides also impacts the most popular stations.

Comparing 2019 and 2020 Top Ten Stations, seven stations were consistent and three stations changed. The stations that dropped from the top ten were Pershing Square North, Broadway & E 14 St, and 8 Ave & W 31 St, which are the closest CitiBike stations to Grand Central Station, Union Square, and Penn Station, respectively. Considering that many of the rides that were lost were weekday commutes, this change in station usage is consistent.

The new stations on the top ten in 2020 were:
 - 1 Ave & E 68 St: Start trips increased from 21,186 in 2019 to 33,180 in 2020. One possible explanation for this station is the density of medical hospitals. The days of the week comparison for this station shows that although weekday trips declined, they were significantly higher compaired to the trend for stations overall, suggesting that these riders are more likely to be essential workers.
 - E 13 St & Avenue A: This station had 28,042 rides starting in 2019 and 28,135 in 2020, which is nearly identical ridership, meaning that this station didn't necessarily increase usage as much as other high use stations dropped in comparison.
 - Pier 40 - Hudson River Park: Start trips increased from 21,569 in 2019 to 27,720 in 2020. One possible explaination about this increase is that the destination, Hudson River Park, is  an access point for outdoor public recreation. Given that indoor entertianment and recreation were signifcantly limited in 2020, it is plausible that more people used the Citi Bikes to access this destination.

## Overall Station Map
Taking a bird's eye view of the stations overall, the closer a station is to the center of Manhattan, the more likely that it is a higher use station. The further a station is from the center of Manhattan, the less likely it is to be a higher use station.

Other reasons why stations have higher usage include proximity to transit hubs. With the exception of 2020 when commuter ridership declined, stations near Grand Central Station, Union Square, and Penn Station were among the highest used stations due to connection to other forms of transit.
